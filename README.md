# gstrap
Gstrap is a modular javascript framework that is meant for rapid web prototyping and best with Deployd backend.

Gstrap is a tiny framework that helps to build modules and plug them to the core application and run quickly.

Its best working with deployd.com. There is an example of how to use framework with a simple todo module in the dpd-example module. It should be good enough to understand the logic.

I will write how to use tutorial latere here.
