# gstrap
Gstrap is a tiny modular javascript framework that is meant for rapid web prototyping and best with Deployd backend.


Its best working with deployd.com as the backend, if you want to quickly try an idea or build an small to larger websites and also to build modules and use them across different projects. There is an example of how to use framework with a simple todo module in the dpd-example folder. It should be good enough to understand the logic.

I will write how to use tutorial later here.
